# Gifs Generator

### A fun web application that renders clickable gifs directly from the GiphyAPI Gifs library. Input a desired animal (or even another subject of your choice), and a set of 10 gifs based on that created button when clicked will render! Click a gif to alter its image state from static to animated!
